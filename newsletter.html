        Basically, Choppahead is a raw, self-made,   grimy, greasy, 
        hard working and hard playing shop that pulls off some pretty clean and class rides. 
        We build and ride back-to-basics old style chops, kustoms and restorations. 
        We're renowned for our classic Triumphs, but build American as well. 
        Choppahead is also on the forefront of the new contemporary (2001+) 
        Triumph chopper scene - offering the first production hardtail frame available for new Triumphs.

        The company was founded in 2000 by Big Truth, and in 2001 Jay signed on as a partner. 
        Truth and Jay had befriended 15 years ago through the Massachusetts hardcore/punk scene 
        (both were in bands), and they both bring that punk rawk DIY ethic over into the chopper industry. 
        Gritty, Loud, Fast, Dangerous, and DIY through and through!

      IMPORTANT: This is the Choppahead mission statement. You see us deviating from it, you let us know. 
      You have ideas on how we can better further these goals, you tell us how. 
      No egos or attitudes here, we are open to Nuff said. Keep riding and keep it strong.
